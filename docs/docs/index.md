# Introduction

## Motivation

Hi, I'm `Rahul Agarwal`. I'm a software engineer with a passion for automating everything. For the past days, I have been trying to craft the perfect resume template that is both visually appealing and easy to maintain.

Well, I have not succeeded yet. There is a debate between using a two-column resume and a one-column resume. I like both formats, but I am not sure which would stand out in the `7.5s` that a recruiter typically spends on a resume.

When I search for resume examples, I often come across the impressive resume of a guy named [Deedy](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume/tree/master).

> His resume template is used by many people I see across videos and blogs. I love his design, but then I question whether a two-column layout is the right choice. `Oh, God, help me!`

## Plan

So hereâ€™s what I plan to do:

- I will create a modified version of Deedy's resume. However, his resume has been tested and accepted by many, so I am unsure if I am making the right decision. Nevertheless, I will give it a try.
- I will also try to create a one-column resume template inspired by Deedy's design.

## Research & Credits

Since, I am a more of an R&D guy, I will also try to list my reaseach & thank the people across the `www` who has really helped me with their blogs, videos, and templates.

So, `thank you everyone for your help`.
